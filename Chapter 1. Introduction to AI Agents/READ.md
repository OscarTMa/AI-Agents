# 📘 Chapter 1 – Introduction to AI Agents

## 🧠 What Are AI Agents?

AI Agents are intelligent systems designed to **perceive their environment, reason about information, and take actions** to achieve specific goals autonomously.

Unlike traditional programs, AI agents can:
- Learn from data and experience.
- Interact dynamically with users or systems.
- Make decisions without explicit instructions for every scenario.

## 🔍 Core Characteristics of an AI Agent

| Feature | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Autonomy** | Acts independently based on goals and inputs. |
| **Perception** | Understands or interprets its environment (text, voice, data, etc.). |
| **Reasoning** | Uses models or logic to make decisions. |
| **Action** | Executes tasks or communicates results. |
| **Learning** | Improves over time through feedback or retraining. |

## ⚙️ Architecture of an AI Agent

A typical AI agent consists of the following components:
```
┌────────────────────┐
│ Environment │

## 🧩 Types of AI Agents

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Reactive Agents** | Respond directly to inputs without memory or reasoning. | Chatbot responding to commands. |
| **Deliberative Agents** | Use reasoning and planning to achieve goals. | Customer support assistant. |
| **Learning Agents** | Improve their behavior using ML models. | Personalized recommendation systems. |
| **Multi-Agent Systems** | Multiple agents collaborating to complete complex tasks. | CEO–PM–Dev simulation for product creation. |

## 🧰 Examples of AI Agents in Use

| Domain | Example |
|---------|----------|
| **Customer Support** | Chatbots powered by GPT or Claude handling FAQ. |
| **Productivity** | Agents scheduling tasks or generating reports automatically. |
| **Research** | Agents summarizing academic papers (Elicit, Scispace). |
| **Coding** | AI Dev Agents generating and reviewing code (GitHub Copilot, Replit Ghostwriter). |
| **Business Intelligence** | Agents that analyze financial data or build dashboards. |

## 🧱 From LLMs to Agents

Large Language Models (LLMs) like **GPT, Claude, Mistral, LLaMA, Gemini** act as the *reasoning core* of most modern agents.

**LLM → Agent Transformation**

| Layer | Purpose |
|-------|----------|
| **Prompt Layer** | Defines instructions or roles. |
| **Memory Layer** | Stores context or user history. |
| **Tool Layer** | Connects the agent with APIs, databases, or external actions. |
| **Controller Layer** | Manages reasoning flow and decision-making. |

Example:
```python
agent = Agent(
    llm="gpt-4",
    memory="chroma",
    tools=["serpapi", "python"],
    controller="AutoGen"
)
agent.run("Summarize AI news and save results to CSV.")
