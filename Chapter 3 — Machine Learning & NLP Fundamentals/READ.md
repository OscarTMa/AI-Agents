# ðŸ¤– Chapter 3 â€” Machine Learning & NLP Fundamentals

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

This chapter introduces the **Machine Learning and NLP** foundations that every AI Agent developer must understand.
You will learn how agents use **embeddings, tokenization, and fine-tuning** to interpret, remember, and reason over language.

---

## ðŸ§  1. Key Concepts

### ðŸ§© Embeddings
Embeddings convert text or tokens into **numerical vectors** that represent semantic meaning.  
These vectors allow agents to measure **similarity** between concepts and perform **contextual reasoning**.

### ðŸ”¡ Tokenization
Tokenization breaks sentences into smaller components â€” tokens â€” which are the basic units of meaning for an LLM.

### ðŸ§® Vectorization
Transforms tokens or entire sentences into vectors in a high-dimensional space, enabling mathematical comparison.

### ðŸ§° Fine-tuning
Fine-tuning adapts pretrained models (like BERT or GPT) to specific tasks, such as classification, sentiment analysis, or intent recognition.

## ðŸ§© 2. How Agents Use Embeddings

AI agents maintain a **vector memory** that stores embeddings of previous interactions.  
When a new query arrives, the agent searches for the most **semantically similar** past embeddings to retrieve context.
