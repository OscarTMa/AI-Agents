# üß† Chapter 5 ‚Äî Agent Architectures & Reasoning

## üéØ Objective
This chapter explores how AI agents **think, reason, and act**, covering the main reasoning architectures used in modern intelligent systems.

---

## 5.1 The ReAct Pattern

### üß© Concept
**ReAct** stands for **Reason + Act** ‚Äî a framework where an agent alternates between *thinking* and *taking actions*.

Instead of directly responding to a query, the agent performs a **reasoning step**, selects a **tool or action**, and continues iteratively until the goal is achieved.

| Step | Description |
|------|--------------|
| Thought | The agent analyzes the context and decides the next step. |
| Action | The agent executes a tool (search, API call, calculation). |
| Observation | It observes the result of the action. |
| Repeat | It continues reasoning based on new observations. |

### üß† Pseudocode
```python
while not goal_reached:
    thought = reason(state)
    action = decide_tool(thought)
    observation = execute(action)
    state.update(observation)
````

## 5.2 Toolformer Architecture
‚öôÔ∏è **Overview**

Toolformer (by Meta AI) introduces the concept of self-instructed tool use:
the model learns when and how to call external tools (like calculators, translators, or APIs) without explicit human intervention.

Component	Function
LLM Core	Generates reasoning and action plans
Tool Plugins	API-like calls (Math, Search, Translate, etc.)
Controller	Decides when a tool call is necessary
Output	Combined result of text reasoning + external execution
üí° Benefit

Agents can dynamically extend their capabilities beyond their internal knowledge.

## 5.3 Reflexion and Chain-of-Thought Models
**üß© Reflexion Loop**

The Reflexion mechanism allows an agent to evaluate its own responses, identify weaknesses, and improve over iterations.

Input ‚Üí Reasoning ‚Üí Action ‚Üí Evaluation ‚Üí Improved Reasoning


This creates a feedback loop that enhances self-correction and adaptability.

üß† Chain-of-Thought (CoT)

The CoT model explicitly captures step-by-step reasoning before producing a final answer.

Example:

Q: What‚Äôs 25 + 37?
Thought: 25 + 37 = 62
A: 62

üöÄ Combined Reflexion + CoT

Combining both approaches enables learning-by-thinking, improving reasoning quality and coherence.

## 5.4 Multi-Agent Collaboration
üß© **Roles and Responsibilities**

In a multi-agent system, agents operate as specialized roles that communicate and cooperate to solve complex problems.

Role	Description
CEO	Defines the main objective and delegates tasks
Researcher	Gathers information, searches data, summarizes
Developer	Implements or tests proposed solutions
üí¨ Message Passing

Agents exchange structured messages:
````
[CEO ‚Üí Researcher]: Find top 3 AI trends in 2025.
[Researcher ‚Üí CEO]: Trends identified: Multi-agent systems, LLM agents, AI orchestration.
[CEO ‚Üí Developer]: Implement a dashboard summarizing these insights.
````

This architecture supports parallel reasoning and task specialization.

## üß© Key Takeaways

ReAct = reasoning + tool use ‚Üí dynamic decision-making.

Toolformer = self-managed tool selection for intelligent actions.

Reflexion = self-evaluation loop for continuous improvement.

Multi-Agent Systems = collaboration and communication for scalability.

üß† Mastering these architectures enables the creation of autonomous, scalable, and adaptive AI systems.

### üß† ReAct Example (LangChain)

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.7)
tools = load_tools(["serpapi", "llm-math"], llm=llm)

react_agent = initialize_agent(
    tools, llm, agent_type="zero-shot-react-description", verbose=True
)

response = react_agent.run("Find the capital of France and calculate the number of letters in it.")
print(response)
````

**Explanation:**
This implements a ReAct-style agent that reasons (thinks) and acts (uses search and math tools) to answer queries dynamically.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Reflexion Loop Example
from langchain import LLMChain, PromptTemplate
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

template = """
Question: {question}
First answer: {initial_answer}
Reflect on your answer and improve it.
Improved answer:
"""
````python
prompt = PromptTemplate(
    input_variables=["question", "initial_answer"],
    template=template
)

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0.6)
chain = LLMChain(llm=llm, prompt=prompt)

response = chain.run({
    "question": "Explain why multi-agent systems improve scalability.",
    "initial_answer": "They divide tasks among several agents."
})
print(response)
````

**Explanation:**
The model reflects on its initial response and improves it ‚Äî simulating Reflexion reasoning.

## üß© Multi-Agent Collaboration (Simplified)

````python
from crewai import Agent, Crew

ceo = Agent(role="CEO", goal="Define company AI strategy")
researcher = Agent(role="Researcher", goal="Gather market data")
developer = Agent(role="Developer", goal="Prototype AI tool")

crew = Crew([ceo, researcher, developer])
result = crew.run("Develop an AI product roadmap for next year.")
print(result)
````

**Explanation:**
A CrewAI example showing three specialized agents communicating to achieve a shared business objective.
